      <p>
        I already had a few goals set for 2022 and I will try my best to achieve
        them. I want to become a full stack developer. So, my focus on learning,
        practicing and hardworking. Before 2022, I didn't know about
        development. Now in 2022, I want to build my carrier with development.
        This is a big change for me. I'm enjoying it. As a human tendency, we
        just try to follow a plan and end up ruining it. But, I will try my best
        to work accordingly to accomplish my goals.
